## ✨ What This Project Demonstrates

This application is a practical guide to connecting LangChain4j application with AI models that are running locally inside Docker, covering:

- **Docker Model Runner Integration**: Utilize Docker Desktop's built-in GenAI features to serve models.
- **Private AI Execution**: Run models like Gemma or Llama 3 completely offline using Docker.
- **Zero-Cost Development**: Experiment with LLMs without worrying about API bills or rate limits.
- **LangChain4j Configuration**: Learn how to point the `langchain4j-open-ai-spring-boot-starter` to a local, OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
